# Task report
A tool that helps co-workers to share what they have been working on.

## How it works?
Each person should report their work daily under tasks. A task belongs to a customer and project. 
At the end of the week, each person submits their report by awnsering a few questions to sum up the collection of reported tasks.
Then, their manager begins the approval process. Finnaly, after has been approval being, it's shared across the team to let them know what is going on.
